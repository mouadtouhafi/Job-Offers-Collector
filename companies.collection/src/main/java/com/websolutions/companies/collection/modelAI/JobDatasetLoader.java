    	This code reads a CSV file that contains job titles and their corresponding fields, then converts each line into a training example 
    	for a machine-learning model. 
    	It first opens the file and checks that it isn’t empty, then finds which columns contain the job title and the field labels by 
    	comparing the header names to predefined constants. 
    	For each line in the file, it splits the text by commas, cleans extra quotation marks, and ignores rows that are blank, malformed, 
    	or missing data. For valid rows, it builds an example by breaking the job title into lowercase word tokens and creating a small 
    	“bag-of-words” map where each unique word becomes a feature with a value of 1.0. 
    	If a title produces no tokens, the row is skipped. 
    	Finally, all the constructed examples are returned as a list, and summary messages show how many rows were kept or dropped.
